  I'm a Ph.D. student in LAMDA (Learning and Mining from data) lab at Ajou University, and currently working as a visiting graduate student in Kim lab (Systems Biology & Biomedical Informatics Laboratory) at University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. My research interests include multi-view learning, network-based analysis, social data mining and biomedical informatics. I have been mostly working on integrating multi-view data using network-based approaches for both social media and bioinformatics area. More specifically, my recent research projects included integrating multi-view networks for social-tagged landmark image clustering and pathway-based multi-omics data integration for breast cancer patients survival prediction.
